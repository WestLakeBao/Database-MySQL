0550. Game Play Analysis IV

-- Write an SQL query that reports the fraction of players that logged in again 
-- on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. 
-- In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive 
-- days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

-- Activity table:
-- +-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
-- | player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
-- +-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
-- | 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
-- | 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
-- | 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
-- | 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
-- | 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
-- +-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

-- Result table:
-- +-----------+
-- | fraction  |
-- +-----------+
-- | 0.33      |
-- +-----------+
-- Only the player with id 1 logged back in after the first day he had logged in so the answer is 1/3 = 0.33
