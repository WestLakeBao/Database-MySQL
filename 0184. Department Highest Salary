Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. 
For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).

+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
+------------+----------+--------+

select Department.name as 'Department', Employee.name as 'Employee', Salary 
from Employee join Department 
on Employee.DepartmentId = Department.Id 
where (Employee.DepartmentId, Salary) in 
(
    select DepartmentId, max(Salary) from Employee group by DepartmentId
);
